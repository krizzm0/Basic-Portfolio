		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src='#' alt='Picture of Me' id='profilePic' />
		<p>This is a paragraph of me. I will include things about me and talk about how great I am! I will probably include my hobbies such as traveling, camping, hiking, extreme sports, gaining knowledge, and experiencing new things. I will also talk about my education and past experiences perhaps?</p>
		<p>I will then include another paragraph about what I am currently doing and dream to achieve. I really want to start my own company someday and be financially independent yet very contributing to my community. Currently I have an idea of trying to get Lawrence, KS to become a plastic bag free zone just like how Austin, TX was when I went to visit!</p>
